<p>Greetings, I am Roshan Joseph. I have a strong interest in design and photography and travel thoroughly.  I completed my 12th grade education at St. Mary's Residential Center School in the science stream. I was raised in Kerala, India, at Alappuzha. My current residence is in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. My family consists of just me, the lone child. My grandfather, father, mother, and dog reside at my house. I enjoy discovering new information and locations. I pay close attention to how I handle my time. When I get an assignment, I'll complete it as fast as I can.

<h2>Choosing a Computer System Technician program with a focus on networking as a foundation for my higher studies aligns well with my aspiration to become an ethical hacker. Here's why:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Relevant Skill Development <p>A networking-focused program provides me with a strong technical foundation in areas such as network infrastructure, security protocols, and data transmission. These skills are essential for understanding the intricacies of computer systems and networks, which are crucial for ethical hacking.</p></li>

<li>Understanding System Architecture <p>By studying computer systems and networks, you'll gain insight into how different components interact and communicate with each other. This understanding is invaluable for identifying vulnerabilities and potential entry points that ethical hackers often exploit during security assessments and penetration testing.</p></li>

<li>Security Knowledge <p>Ethical hacking involves understanding both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques. By delving into networking concepts within this program, I'll likely cover topics related to network security, encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems. This knowledge will be essential for assessing and enhancing the security posture of systems and networks ethically.</p></li>

<li>Career Path Alignment <p>A solid background in computer systems and networking lays a strong foundation for pursuing a career in cybersecurity, including ethical hacking. Many ethical hackers come from backgrounds in IT, networking, or computer science due to the overlap in skills and knowledge required for both fields.</p></li>

<li>Continuous Learning Opportunities <p>Ethical hacking is a dynamic field that requires continuous learning and adaptation to stay ahead of emerging threats and security trends. I chose this program because it will likely provide opportunities for hands-on experience, practical labs, and exposure to real-world networking scenarios, all of which are valuable for honing your skills as an ethical hacker.
