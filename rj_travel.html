<h2>Kulamavu Dam</h2></a>
</section>
<p>
The <strong>Kulamavu Dam</strong> is a significant dam located in the Indian state of Kerala. It is part of the Idukki Hydroelectric Project, which is one of the largest hydroelectric projects in Kerala. The dam is constructed across the Periyar River and is situated near the town of Idukki.
The construction of the Kulamavu Dam was initiated as part of the broader Idukki Hydroelectric Project in the 1960s. The primary purpose of the dam is to generate hydroelectric power. The reservoir formed by the dam, known as the Kulamavu Reservoir, has a substantial storage capacity, which aids in power generation and irrigation purposes in the region.
The Idukki Hydroelectric Project consists of multiple dams and power stations, with the Kulamavu Dam being one of the key components. It has contributed significantly to the power generation capacity of Kerala and has helped in meeting the energy demands of the state.
Besides its role in power generation, the Kulamavu Dam and its reservoir also offer opportunities for tourism and recreational activities, attracting visitors with its scenic beauty and the surrounding lush greenery.

<h2>Rosemala</h2>
</section>
</a>
<p>
Situated around 15 km profound into the woods from Aryankavu, <strong>Rosemala</strong> is one of the less explored eco tourism spots in Kerala in Kollam district. The woodland street prompting Rosemala is steep and winding. You can enjoy the quietness of a few mountain streams on your way through the thick woodland tracts. Enlisting a jeep would be the best decision to achieve Rosemala.

Begin your trekking by wandering into Darbhakkulam, a lake somewhere inside Rosemala. Darbha is the name for Poa cynosuroides, a plant which has got criticalness in Hindu ceremonies. It is assumed that once this place was loaded with these plants. While in transit to Darbhakkulam watch the woodland that abounds with life and rich in biodiversity. Watch uncommon types of butterflies, mushrooms and frogs.

The main attraction in Rosemala is the forest, watch tower, and the view of lake from the watch tower. The watchtower unveils the beauty of Thenmala Dam reservoir surrounded by gigantic hills. There are options for boating in the lake for that you have to get the permission from Shenduruney Wildlife Sanctuary.
